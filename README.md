# Diablo-Bot

This Python Discord Bot was made using "discord.py". The bot is designed to be able to run 24 hours a day, with close to no maintenance needed. 

The main intent of the bot is to guarantee fair trades in the game "Diablo 4 Resurrected" between users by using a homemade reputation system. 
This project was a custom bot request for a fairly active Discord Server (~10k Users). This is the second major Discord Bot I wrote, I used to contribute to
"PyBot", an internal administration and Moderation Bot used on a big French Gaming Discord Server (La Confr√©rie: ~ 200k Users). The architecture of the Diablo Bot
is inspired by the old Architecture of PyBot, as it has been allready field-tested and proved itself in practical use.

The bot was developped with a constant feedback loop of the Staff of the Discord Server, with several Testing Rounds, to find any major bugs. The bot focusses additionaly a lot on modularity and reusability of code (Usage of discord "cogs", and common libraries).

The approximate time spent developping the bot until its final version was about 250 hours, including Testing Sessions, Design Meetings, Bug Fixing and Coding Timne.
